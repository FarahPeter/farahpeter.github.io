        <div class="about">
        <p>
I am a cybersecurity and network engineer with a strong passion for advancing technology and fostering innovation. With a Bachelor's in Computer and Communication Engineering from the American University of Beirut and a Master's in Cybersecurity from the prestigious Institut Polytechnique de Paris, where I graduated with the highest distinction, I am driven by my dedication to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.<br><br>
My professional experience includes working at Dar, where I played a key role in managing Cisco switches, automating security processes, and ensuring robust network operations. I have also honed my skills during internships at Exeo and POTECH, where I integrated diverse systems to enhance network security and developed web scraping tools to automate reconnaissance tasks.<br><br>
Most recently, I completed a research internship where I developed a state-of-the-art classification framework for identifying Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms in bottleneck routers. This project consisted of multiple C programs for generating UDP traffic and capturing RTT traces, combined with Python scripts for orchestration, coordination, simulation, and classification. The framework used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and advanced comparison techniques to accurately distinguish between algorithms such as CoDel, FQ-CoDel, Cake, PIE, RED, FIFO, and FQ. In addition, I implemented a Python-based simulation of the CoDel algorithm to study the impact of network parameters and estimate total experiment durations. Together, these components formed a comprehensive system that advanced the understanding and detection of traffic management techniques in real-world networks.<br><br>
I am particularly passionate about leveraging technology to build secure and resilient networks. I thrive in environments that encourage collaboration and innovation, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and contribute to meaningful advancements in the field of cybersecurity. My commitment to education and staying ahead of emerging threats enables me to develop solutions that address both current and future challenges in network and information security.
